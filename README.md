# Indain_Address_Parser -- Parses a given address.

# What it does
A typical Indian address contains many fields. Our program tries parse all the fields present.

# How to use
1. Download the Countries.xls or you can use your own data, but for this code to work the data should be in the format as it is in the Countries.xls

2. Download the Localities.xls or you can use your own data, but for this code to work the data should be in the format as it is in the Localities.xls . Here I have used localities of only one District.

4. Read the summary_address_parser.txt

5. Run the python file.
